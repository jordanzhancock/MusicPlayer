Welcome to the Flutter Music Player GitHub repository! This repository houses a minimalist yet feature-rich music player app built using Flutter. The app boasts an intuitive interface with a neumorphic design and a few functional buttons such as the play button and info button.

Beyond its music-playing capabilities, the app introduces a unique “Artist Info” section, where users can delve deeper into the lives of their favorite artists. When a song is in play, users can seamlessly access this section, revealing a captivating GIF and a sliver of information about the current artist. 

This is a short project which will be continually built upon to add more features such as music seeker selection, skip forward and backward, and the entire album songs as a playlist.
